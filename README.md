# MernBlog
Its a blogging application that I developed with the help of "Learn, Apply, Build a Blog Project using Redux (Redux Toolkit), NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, React js, Tailwindcss" by i novotek Academy (Udemy). I made few tweaks as per my preference like I used postgres and its supported tooling instead of mongodb as shown in course and I used AWS SES and AWS S3 for emails and file storage. Repository is open for everyone.
